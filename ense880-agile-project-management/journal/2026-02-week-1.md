## Sun 22 Feb – Pre‑class prep

### What I did

- Browsed the ENSE880 course overview slides.
- Revisited two videos by Prof. Pete Carr:
  - "How to Write a Paper in a Weekend"
  - "How to Read Papers"
- Started capturing notes in Google Keep and my inventory.

### Key ideas captured

- “The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory” – prioritise externalised notes.
- Use index cards or a central system so notes are searchable and in one place.

**Paper reading workflow:**

- **Survey:** Title, keywords, abstract, conclusion – stop if not aligned.
- **Read:** Tables/figures → introduction → results → experiments → discussion.
- **Take notes:** In a separate space, not on the paper itself.

**Choosing a research project:**

- Prioritise mentorship and marketable skills.
- Keep the project small and feasible within a Master’s timeframe.
- Define data and its availability early.
- Clarify broad interests (e.g., habits, communication, “supercommunicators”).
- Use literature review to find unresolved gaps.
- Ask: does this question need answering, and is it doable in my timeframe?

### Reflection

- These PhD‑oriented tips still apply to my 9‑month Master's research project.
- I need a robust note‑taking system that can bridge reading now with project work in second semester.

## Mon 23 Feb – Lecture 1

### Lecture themes

- Knowledge is key; best way to reach lecturer is email.
- Combine paper research with interviews and surveys.
- Professor’s research: specialised roles (e.g., QA) being replaced by more generalist software engineers.
- Focus on **industry project development**.
- PMI knowledge areas are central to the paper.
- Large‑scale software development is affecting everything (complexity, DevSecOps, ERP, secure SDLC).
- ERP implementations are often regarded as failures.
- Project management covers product, programme, and portfolio; it’s a way of delivering value.
- Industry lunchtime series – something to watch out for.
- Encouragement to seek part‑time work, even outside IT, to gain local experience.
- Specialised PM roles are rarer; more individual contributors are expected to handle PM tasks.
- PM competency includes behaviours, not just tools and techniques.
- Framing question: why do IT projects fail, and how are they different from capital projects?

### Concepts from overview slides

- **PMI process groups (the “when”):** Initiate, Plan, Execute, Monitor, Close.
- **PMI knowledge areas (the “what”):** Integration, Scope, Cost, Risk, Procurement, Schedule, Quality, Resource, Communication, Stakeholder.

**Research and writing notes:**

- Think of literature review as arguments supported by evidence.
- Mark where references are needed and maintain index cards or a reference log.
- Research methods: what did you do (experiment design, data collection, statistical analysis).
- Analytical writing: how you communicate the work you did.

### Assessment notes

- Assignment 1a, 1b, 1c in first 10 weeks.
- Assignment 2 scheduled for weeks 11–13.
- Emphasis on Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD).

### Reflection

- I should map PMI knowledge areas to my past analytics and ETL work.
- “Why IT projects fail” feels like a natural bridge between my background and this paper.
